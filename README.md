React Query (now officially known as TanStack Query) is a powerful data-fetching library for React applications. It helps manage server state — data that comes from an external source like an API — making it easier to fetch, cache, synchronize, and update.
 Core Features:

    Fetching Data: Simplifies API calls using hooks like useQuery.

    Caching: Caches API responses and serves them instantly while refetching in the background.

    Automatic Background Syncing: Keeps data fresh by automatically refetching on window focus, reconnect, or intervals.

    Mutation Support: Handles POST/PUT/DELETE requests via useMutation.

    Query Invalidation: Refetches specific data automatically after a mutation or manually when needed.

    Devtools: Provides powerful browser Devtools to inspect and debug queries.
